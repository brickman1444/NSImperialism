# NSImperialism
![Go](https://github.com/brickman1444/NSImperialism/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

An optional extension to https://www.nationstates.net/ to simulate geographic interactions between nations. Like [NSEconomy](http://www.broomdces.com/nseconomy/) but for imperialism and warfare instead of economics and budgets. This was previously live at https://nsimperialism.net/ but is currently defunct.
